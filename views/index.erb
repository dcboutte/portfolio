		<h3> "While my experience with photographers is limited I do know my experience with Dani was wonderful because she understands whats she's doing so well. She changed locations and looked frequently so that neither of us got bored or ran out of ideas. And at the end when we looked through the photos we had such a plethera of photos to choose from that were gold." </h3>
