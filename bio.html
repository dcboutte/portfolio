		<p>Hi, I'm Danielle Boutte, owner of DCBoutte Photography. Welcome! As a photographer, I've captured many moments over the years. Some planned, some unplanned, some private, but all wonderful. I consider myself lucky to have spent my early years in beautiful Rappahannock County, Virginia, where I spent quite a bit of time in the mountains, discovering what lens or camera works in what natural environment, while learning what makes a powerful photo. I grew up with nature and will always try to promote its beauty as long as I exist. If you have any questions or interests in my photography, job wise, hiring wise, or general information about the equipment I use, feel free to email me, or direct message me on instagram through my 
			<a href="contact-page.html"> Contact Info</a> page. If you are also looking for a photographer for your next event, let's talk. I can usually accommodate any request and can work within any budget, unless you decide to go with one of the packages. I would be proud to capture the moments of your life!

			<p> With the creation of smartphones and their truly notable camera capabilities, we can all take impressive snapshots of the world around us. But what makes engaging a professional photographer worthwhile is their ability to find the moment in the moment- the sidelong glance from a passerby while taking a shot of a bride and groom, a sparrow's flight while photographing a gorgeous Dogwood. So, as you can see, it's not just about the photo, but about the photographer's ability to find the unexpected details that bring the moment to life.
