		<p>Hi everyone, welcome to my website. If you have any questions or interests in my photography, job wise, hiring wise, or general information about the equipment I use, feel free to email me, or direct message me on my 
			<a href="contact-page.html"> Contact Info</a> page. I use many different attributes for my cameras when it comes to taking photos. I am skilled in Photoshop, Gimp and other photo editing softwares. I also created this very website you are viewing now. I'm still getting the hang of front end design, so you will probably see many changes to this website as time goes on. You can call me Dani, let me tell you a bit about myself.

			<p> I grew up in the country, and had taken many photos of nature growing up, many of which include the blue ridge mountains. I was born in 1994 and I still love exploring, which I know will never die in me. If I get a chance to be in nature I will be. I grew up with many animals, which you will probably see them in many of my photos. I began to notice that I loved taking photos when I began taking my camera to school in late highschool, taking photos for the school yearbook. This lead to other things, and in my college career I finally got contracted, taking photos of different groups and graduation portraits.

			Some fun facts about me, I think banana chips smell like dog food, but I still consider them one of my favorite foods. I do beleive in certain types of luck, which mine is not the best, an example of this, (since many beleive that they have bad luck) I once got stuck in an elevator for over an hour, with the lights flashing on and off during the 60 + minutes. I also still carry on the tradition of talking in pig latin to the few who still remember the language and allow themselves to talk in it. </p>
